# Amazon EBS CSI Driver for Amazon EKS

The **Amazon EBS CSI (Elastic Block Store Container Storage Interface) driver** for Amazon EKS enables Kubernetes clusters to use Amazon EBS volumes as persistent storage. It simplifies the management of storage in EKS clusters by leveraging native EBS capabilities while adhering to the CSI standard.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Provisioning**: Automatically provisions EBS volumes based on the storage requirements specified in Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).
2. **Volume Snapshots**: Supports creating snapshots of EBS volumes, enabling backup and recovery.
3. **Volume Resizing**: Allows you to resize EBS volumes dynamically without downtime or manual intervention.
4. **Multi-AZ Support**: Ensures that EBS volumes can be attached to nodes in the same availability zone (AZ) as the volume.
5. **Volume Encryption**: Supports encryption for data at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
6. **Volume Types**: Supports different EBS volume types such as General Purpose SSD (gp2, gp3), Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1, io2), Throughput Optimized HDD (st1), and Cold HDD (sc1).

## Advantages

1. **Native Integration with AWS**: Seamlessly integrates with AWS services, ensuring that storage provisioning and management take advantage of AWS’s cloud capabilities.
2. **Automated Volume Management**: Automatically provisions and manages volumes based on Kubernetes specifications, reducing manual overhead.
3. **Scalability**: Easily scales as your workloads grow, providing highly available and durable storage.
4. **Cost Optimization**: By supporting different EBS volume types, you can choose cost-efficient storage based on your application’s IOPS and throughput requirements.
5. **Data Durability**: Provides data durability by leveraging AWS’s EBS storage, which replicates data within the same AZ.
6. **Backup and Restore**: With snapshot support, it’s easy to create backups of your volumes and restore them when necessary.

## Use Cases

1. **Stateful Applications**: Ideal for applications that require persistent storage, such as databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB), where each instance needs its own dedicated volume.
2. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Supports creating volume snapshots for backup, making it useful for disaster recovery solutions.
3. **Large Data Processing**: For applications that handle large datasets (e.g., analytics pipelines), EBS can provide the necessary throughput and IOPS.
4. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Useful in CI/CD systems where build artifacts or Docker images need to be stored on persistent volumes across deployments.
5. **Machine Learning Workloads**: Machine learning models and datasets can be stored on persistent EBS volumes, ensuring data persistence across model training sessions.
6. **Logs and Monitoring**: Storing logs or monitoring data from Prometheus or Elasticsearch requires persistent volumes that are durable and scalable.

## How to Use the EBS CSI Driver

### 1. Install the EBS CSI Driver

Ensure your EKS cluster is running a supported version of Kubernetes (1.14+). Install the EBS CSI driver using `kubectl` or Helm. The following command installs it via Helm:

```bash
helm repo add aws-ebs-csi-driver https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-ebs-csi-driver
helm install aws-ebs-csi-driver aws-ebs-csi-driver/aws-ebs-csi-driver \
--namespace kube-system
```

### 2. Create a StorageClass
Define a StorageClass to specify the type of EBS volume and any additional parameters, such as encryption or IOPS:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: ebs-sc
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  type: gp2
  fsType: ext4
reclaimPolicy: Retain
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```
### 3. Create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)
Create a PersistentVolumeClaim that references the StorageClass:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: ebs-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: ebs-sc
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```
### 4. Attach the Volume to a Pod

Once the PVC is created, you can attach it to a Pod in the Kubernetes deployment:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ebs-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: "/var/lib/data"
      name: ebs-volume
  volumes:
  - name: ebs-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: ebs-pvc
```
### 5. Manage Snapshots (Optional)

You can create snapshots from an EBS volume for backup purposes. The CSI driver supports snapshot creation and management using Kubernetes resources.
Example of Creating a Snapshot:
```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: ebs-snapshot
spec:
  volumeSnapshotClassName: ebs-csi-snapshot
  source:
    persistentVolumeClaimName: ebs-pvc
```
